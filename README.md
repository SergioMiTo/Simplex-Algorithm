# Simplex-Algorithm
Implementation of the simplex algorithm to fitting curves to data. 

This code is based on the Simplex Algorithm implemented by Marco S. Caceci and William P. Cacheris in their article "Fitting curves to data: The simplex algorithm is the answer". This code has been generated within the HESSP project has received funding from the European Unionâ€™s Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme under grant agreement No 898052.
